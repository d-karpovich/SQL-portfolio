# SQL-portfolio of Dmitry Karpovich
This repository contains examples of PostgreSQL I've written as pet projects while working through the SQL module of the data analytics course. Below are a few highlighted projects with descriptions. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karpovichdmitry/) if you have any feedback or questions.

## Highlights
### [Flight bookings analysis](https://github.com/d-karpovich/SQL-portfolio/blob/main/Flight%20bookings/Bookings%20Analysis.sql)
Database of flights between Russian airports in 2016.

This project consists of 9 complex queries and shows the advanced PostgreSQL skillset I got.

All queries were tested on the large dataset (1-year dataset, database size - 2502 MB). They didn't crash the database and showed appropriate time and query cost.

### [DVD-rental analysis](https://github.com/d-karpovich/SQL-portfolio/blob/main/DVD-rental/DVD-rental%20Analysis.sql)
This is a training database with information about purchases in the DVD store with several branches. 

The main goal of this project was practising different types of queries using multiple joins, cte, case expressions, and window functions.
