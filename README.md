# SQL-portfolio of Dmitry Karpovich
This repository contains examples of SQL I've written as pet projects while working through the SQL module of the data analytics course. Below are a few highlighted projects with descriptions and diagrams of databases. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karpovichdmitry/) if you have any feedback or questions.

### DVD-rental database analysis
This is a training database with information about purchases in the DVD store with several branches. The main goal of this project was to train different types of queries using multiple joins, cte, and window functions.
